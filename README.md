# Forbes-Billionaires-2022-Plotly-Visuals-EDA

### ðŸ‘‰ Context
The Forbes Billionaires list focuses on the world's richest individuals and provides insight on how old they are, which industry they are part of, and what part of the world they come from. This caught my eye as a less traditional tool to evaluate which industries are growing, which areas of the world are capitalizing on industry growth, and if there are trends in billionaire demographics that would point to what characterizes the next group of billionaires. 

### ðŸ“ŠObjective
Visualize the data produced from the Forbes 2022 Billionaires list using Plotly visuals. 

### ðŸ“„Data sources
